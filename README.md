# Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Overview  
This **Movie Recommendation System** is a personalized platform built using collaborative filtering and content-based approaches. Designed to enhance user experiences, it suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history, leveraging data science techniques and machine learning models.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies by analyzing user similarities.  
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Suggests movies based on attributes like genre, cast, and keywords.  
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines collaborative and content-based techniques for accurate predictions.  
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Provides an intuitive platform for users to explore recommendations.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Flask (for web interface)  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for model development and testing

## ⚙️ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation-System.git  
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## 📊 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized movie datasets for optimal model performance.  
2. **Model Development:**  
   - **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user-item interaction matrices.  
   - **Content-Based Filtering:** Employs TF-IDF and cosine similarity.  
3. **Web Interface:** A Flask-based interface to display recommendations.  

## 🧪 Usage  
Start the Flask application:  
```bash  
python src/app.py  
```  
Access the web app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and get personalized movie recommendations!  

## 📝 Results  
- **Precision:** Achieved a recommendation precision of 87% on a validation dataset.  
- **Scalability:** Handles datasets with over 10,000 movies efficiently.  

## 📖 Future Enhancements  
- Add real-time user feedback for improved recommendations.  
- Integrate streaming service APIs for dynamic recommendations.  
- Extend support for multilingual movie titles.
